Ticket Fiend

This is search engine designed to create an easier way to find tickets for entertainment (music, sports, theater, comedy) in your area without having to visit multiple sites.

It incorporates the SeatGeek API, which provides secure access to 60+ ticket sites on the web - both direct and reseller - so the user can search multiple sites at the same time AND feel comfortable knowing the purchase is legitimate.

The headar search function allows the user to look for a specific band, team, or event, with our without knowing the date or location.

The body serach function provides broader results based on user input for either concerts, sports, or performances.  This requires a zip code to be entered and then returns the top results within a 15 mile radius and 7 day window of time.

We plan to include recommendations in the future.
